  There once was a boy who decided that peanuts were too hard for his teeth. Coming to this conclusion, he ascended the highest peak of Mt. Arachis Hypogaea, and sat there meditating for two thousand and sixty four years. His concentration was stellar; hunger, sleep, reasoning, never got in the way of his goal. One day, an epiphany came upon him, as he continued in his daily routine. A strange voice told him that to soften his peanuts, he would need to perform an ancient ritual known only to the oldest elders, all of whom have died off. He was given the knowledge, and for the first time in a very long time he stood up and stretched. With his willpower renewed, he returned home in order to gather the supplies he needed: a bowl, water and peanuts.
He filled the bowl with water and carefully placed each individual peanut in as to not disrupt the process. Such a delicate ritual had to be executed perfectly in order to achieve the desired result. Then, after exactly 6 days, 3 hours, a minute and 5 seconds, he removed each peanut in the same order that he added them so that each nut soaked for the perfect amount of time. It was then the moment of truth. The ritual was complete, and now the boy only needed to taste the peanuts and test his work. He placed the first peanut in his mouth.
